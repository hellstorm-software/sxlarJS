- <b>homepage-text-scroll.js</b> :: <i>a script that will take the contents of the "scrolling-text" div, and scroll it vertically across the screen before loading the main website in the "main-content" div</i><br>
- <b>matrix.js</b> :: <i>a simple script that will create a red and purple matrix falling effect in the cavas with the id "CMatrix"</i><br>
